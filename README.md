# httpd-logslice

This is a work-in-progress PHP library and command-line utility designed to parse and filter Apache log files quickly and easily. For now, it is focused on processing standard combined-format access logs, but I plan to expand this to allow error log parsing as well as custom formats.

This is still very much in the early stages of development and is being worked on as a personal project. You're welcome to experiment with the code or submit pull requests. More detailed information and usage instructions will be made available as the project moves closer to a first release state.

## Usage

`bin/httpd-logslice logfile:filter path/to/file`

Filtering options and alternate modes have not yet been implemented. Stay tuned.
